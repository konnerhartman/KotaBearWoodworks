        <p>My name is Kevin. I have been building with wood since I was a young man. My first jobs were building houses. I've always been a DIYer. As I aged and moved out of the construction business, I always kept at it by doing side projects for friends and family. Woodworking is my true passion and I enjoy being able to bring others ideas to life.</p>
